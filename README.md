# Hi, it's Jean

AI & Computer Science student with a strong interest in Machine Learning, Speech Recognition, and intelligent systems.

I’ve worked on multiple projects across:
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Speech & audio-based systems
- Recommendation systems
- Model evaluation & experimentation

This GitHub is a collection of my learning journey — from fundamentals to applied projects.
I’m comfortable reading research papers, experimenting with models, and turning ideas into working code.

Currently:
- Building ML/DL projects
- Writing my thesis about Automated Short Answer Scoring
- Preparing myself to step into the industry

Always learning. Ready to work.
